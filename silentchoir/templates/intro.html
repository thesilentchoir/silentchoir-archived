                The Silent Choir is a secure, safe, reporting tool for survivors to name their offender(s). Based on these anonymous reports, we aim to connect survivors who have been harassed or abused by the same offender.
                </p>

                <p>
                By connecting survivors in this way, we hope to create a path to accountability that may pave the way towards healing. We aim to democratize the tools that have been available to the victims of such high profile cases as Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby.
