                Security is our highest priority. Absolutely everything submitted to this site will be scrubbed of any identifiers, encrypted (detail) and stored in a way that we, nor anybody else, cannot trace it back to you.

            	<p>
				Nothing is easy about reporting harassment and abuse and our utmost priority is your security. It is our obligation to create a legal framework that protects you from undermining a potential legal case but also from being sued for speaking out.
                </p>

				<p>
				For this reason, at this time, we are only taking reports from those who are ready to consider potential legal action against their offenders. If you feel that you would never be comfortable revealing your identity to a legal advocate or therapist (even if you knew that you are not alone with your experience), we strongly discourage you from continuing with a report.
                </p>

				<p>
                However, if knowing you are not alone, you would be wiling to discuss your options with a legal advocate, then let’s proceed.
